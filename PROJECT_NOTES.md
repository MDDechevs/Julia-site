# Julia Todorova Website — Continuation Notes

Use this file as the quick handoff for future chat sessions. It intentionally keeps source info, image references, and working preferences; it does **not** track every design tweak.

## Project
- Local project: `/Users/User/.openclaw/workspace/julia-todorova-site`
- Type: Bulgarian one-page business-card / landing page for a psychologist in Sofia.
- Deployment: GitHub `origin/main` is connected to the live Vercel site. Do not deploy before final approval.
- Local preview:
  ```bash
  cd /Users/User/.openclaw/workspace/julia-todorova-site
  python3 -m http.server 5173
  ```
  Open: `http://localhost:5173`

## Blog Publishing Workflow
These notes are only for this Julia Todorova site. Do not treat them as general rules for other projects.

- Add `Блог` in the main navigation and keep `/blog/` as the article list page.
- Blog list intro copy currently approved:
  - H1: `Статии за човешките ни противоречия, за връзките, които ни оформят, и за отношението ни към самите нас.`
  - Supporting line: `Текстове на Джулия Тодорова`
- For imported LinkedIn articles, use the LinkedIn original publish date as the original article date and the website publication date as the site date.
- Show both dates in the article byline:
  - `Публикувано в LinkedIn: ...`
  - `Публикувано в сайта: ...`
- Use the compact author/date row under the article title: small circular `assets/julia-todorova-razkazhimi.jpg`, author name, and both dates.
- Use the same compact author/date treatment on blog cards.
- Article pages should be readable, not wall-of-text: clear H2s, short paragraphs, source list, image captions, and a bottom author box.
- Bottom author box copy currently approved:
  - `Джулия Тодорова`
  - `Клиничен психолог и психотерапевт. Работи с възрастни, деца и родители, срещащи трудности в грижата за децата си.`
- Bottom author image should use `assets/julia-todorova-razkazhimi.jpg` with a crop that does not cut off her head.
- For article images, place each image near the matching source/argument in the article flow, and include visible caption/source links.
- For the current Picasso/Cubism article:
  - Featured image caption: `Пабло Пикасо, „Герника“, 1937. Източник`
  - Place `Госпожиците от Авиньон` under the paragraph beginning `Кубизмът се характеризира...`
  - Place `Fruit Dish` under the paragraph beginning `Синтетичният кубизъм...`
  - Do not keep broken source links. If an academic source blocks direct linking, use plain DOI text instead of a clickable broken link.

- SEO alt text ideas:

  - `Психологическа консултация в София`

## CTA / Conversion Preferences
- Primary CTA should be phone-first: **“Запазете час”** linking to `tel:+359878194843`.
- She prefers phone call as the main action.
- Superdoc and LinkedIn can appear as quiet secondary links, not primary CTAs.
- No contact form for now; avoid GDPR hassle.
- Main promise should balance SEO and real user trust, not keyword stuffing.
- Do **not** mention Superdoc reviews/rating on the site.
- Testimonials: real testimonials only if approved. For presentation, placeholders are okay but should be clearly replaceable and not fake “5-star review” style.

## Tone / UX Preferences
- Bulgarian only.
- Tone: calm, serious, warm, credible, professional; not salesy, not overly clinical.
- Target patients likely need calm, clarity, privacy, and trust.
- Design direction: warm beige/cream base, muted sage/olive, deep charcoal text, soft warm accent. Avoid clinic-blue and flashy startup feel.
- Avoid visual chaos: too many cards/boxes create stress. Prefer calm hierarchy and breathing room.
- Typography must have clear hierarchy: section titles and card titles need to be visibly stronger than body text.
- Keep mobile-first behavior strong; most visitors will likely open from phone.

## SEO Intent
Primary keyword themes:
- `психолог София`
- `психотерапевт София`
- `психолог бул. Витоша`
- `психоаналитична психотерапия София`
- `психолог тревожност София`

SEO structure to preserve:
- H1 should balance user trust + SEO, e.g. psychologist in Sofia for anxiety/stress/life difficulties.
- Local NAP consistency: name, address, phone should match across site/profiles.
- Include Google Maps/address section.
- Keep structured data/schema, Bulgarian `lang="bg"`, meta title/description, Open Graph, sitemap, robots.

Potential Google Business Profile setup, but actual submission/verification requires Julia/Dean approval and Google account access.
